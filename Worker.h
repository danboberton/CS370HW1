/*
1. Dynamically allocate and de-allocate a random sized array for each iteration.
2. Populate elements in the array with random integers.
3. For each iteration, generate a random integer to be used as a divisor.
4. For each element in the array, check if the element is divisible, and if so count it.
5. Calculate the ratio of elements divisible by divisor to elements not divisible by the divisor.
---- Number of Divisible Elements /Number of Non-Divisble Elements ----
6. At the end print the iteration number with maximum number of divisible elements.
7. Return the average value of the ratio divisible/not_divisible for all iterations to Initiator
Hint: you are computing the total number of divisible items over the total
number of iterations
